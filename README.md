# Phase 2 Project: Joshua Mwale React Project App

Description
In this project, I am have created a movie listing app using React. It is a single page application. I have five components that include App.js (parent component), Home (landing page), MovieList (my movie container), MovieForm, Movie and Navbar.

The github link(remote repository) for my project is: [https://github.com/joshuamwale/Joshua-Mwale-React-App-project]

What I want users to get from this app is search for their favorite movies and also add to the existing offerings. 

I am using external data from a free to access API IMDB. The API url is: ["https://imdb-api.com/en/API/SearchMovie/k_x652c43h/leon%20the%20professional"]



I created a base server for my project. The base URL for my backend is: [http://localhost:8000/movies]
