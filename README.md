# Phase 2 Project: Joshua Mwale React Project App
Github link:
The github link(remote repository) for my project is: [https://github.com/joshuamwale/Joshua-Mwale-React-App-project]

Description:
In this project, I have created a movie listing app using React. It is a single page application. I have five components that include App.js (parent component), Home (landing page), MovieList (my movie container), MovieForm, Movie and Navbar. 

The Navbar carries the links to various elements of the app notably the home, movielist and movieform components. I have used three client-side routes so that whenever each is clicked it will display the content it carries. This makes the app navigable for users. 

What I want users to get from this app is for them to browse an existing list of movies and also add their favorite ones to the existing offerings. With the add functionality, it is easy to enrich the list and make the app more resourceful.

I have incoporated external data from a free to access API from IMDB. The API url is: ["https://imdb-api.com/en/API/SearchMovie/k_x652c43h/leon%20the%20professional"]

I created a REST API json-server for my project. The base URL for my backend is: [http://localhost:8000/movies]
